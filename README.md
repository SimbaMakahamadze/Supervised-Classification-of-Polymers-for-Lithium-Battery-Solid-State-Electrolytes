# Supervised-Classification-of-Polymers-for-Lithium-Battery-Solid-State-Electrolytes
This is repository contains the code, data, and results from my BSc honours project,
"Supervised classification of Polymers for Lithium Battery Solid-State Electrolytes".
The aim of this study, is to use a data-driven approach to identify novel polymers for
lithium Metal Battery electrolytes. In this project I develop 5 machine learning models
using the Scikit-learn library, RDKit, and the Pedatamine
polymer electrolyte database, https://github.com/nschauser/PolymerElectrolyte. The best 
model, a small neural network, is then used to classify polymers within the vast PI1M 
polymer database, https://github.com/RUIMINMA1996/PI1M, based on an archetypal PEO benchmark.
The high-throughput virtual screening processing of the PI1M database revealed 1611 polymers. 
Most of which have a high potential for lithium-ion conducting ability and remain untested.
